There are some papers which might interest you. If you plan on hacking
on Yi, it's very recommended that you read these

* [An editor in Haskell for Haskell][small-yi]

* [Lazy Functional Incremental Parsing][lazy-parsing] in Yi

* [A JavaScript Mode for Yi][js]

* [Robust & Precise incremental parsing of Haskell][precise-haskell]
  talks about the precise Haskell mode.
